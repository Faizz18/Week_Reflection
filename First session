The very first session for the Exploring Digital Technology Course .

The session started with introductions of our name and why we chose this course as our occupational track ,and what we hoped to achieve by the end of the course . 

And I was the first one to introduce myself. My  answer was that of not having any clue of why I took this course . But , it was interesting to hear different perspectives of others , and many who were also confused were the same as me . 

Even though I was confused , I was looking forward to learning more about technology. 

After the introductions , we were divided into groups of five people . 
And we were given a task of going around campus - and to look for everything around us that is considered technology. 

And to be honest , it was quite surprising enough to see how well we are  integrated with technology and how it shapes our life from day to day . 

We saw people using their phones, laptops and tablets, the water filters , the food ordering machine , biometrics , cctvâ€™s , automatic doors , simple objects like lights, fan , and AC etc. 

And then each group was asked to share a quick summary of the things they observed . 

It was quite a good start for the course .
