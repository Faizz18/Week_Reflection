Some of my learnings from the command shell - 

The first thing is I learnt how to make a folder 
You just type - $ mkdir temp 

And if you want to go even deeper the -
$ mkdir temp/stuff
$ mkdir temp/stuff/things

And if you want to make multiple directories at a time rather time typing mkdir a hundred times then you can just -
$ mkdir -p temp/stuff/things/frank/joe/alex/john

The -p tells the linux to make all these directories at a time if they don't exist . 

So everytime you go inside folders , you’re actually moving along a path . 
A path is the location of a file or a folder on our computer, that tells the computer exactly where a file is saved . . We could think of it as a set of directions to  the computer - it needs to know which folders to open to find our file. 

Furthermore, to not lose track of where we are we can use the $pwd command . 
pwd stands for “print working directory” . 
It shows the full path of our current location in the terminal . 

If we want to move into another folder , use the  cd command ($ cd temp)
cd stands for “Changing directory” 
It takes you inside the temp folder . But if the folder doesn't exist then, Linux will show an error . 


The first simple command we used is  $pwd
pwd which means "print working directory." It returns the full path of your current directory in the terminal. 

Also some more useful commands that we learnt -

List Directory (ls) - $ ls
The $ls command lists out the contents of the directory you are currently in. It shows files, directories.

Command $ls -l is used if we want more detailed output like permissions, size etc.

Command $ls -a is used to include the hidden files.

For deleting an empty directory, use the rmdir command($ rmdir folder-name)



If there are any files or directories inside , it won't delete it . 

And if you want to delete a file (not a folder )  then use the command - $ rm file-name
The rm command removes files .
