Software And Hardware Systems 

These are my notes from the unit 1 

Types of Computers 

Personal computers -  these are commonly used by people for normal tasks .
Servers -  These are designed to manage network resources and serve data to other computers.
Supercomputers -  Very powerful computers which are used for complex computations . 

There are five major types of units of a computer 

Input unit 
Output Unit 
Memory Unit 
Arithmetic and Logic Unit 
Control Unit 

The role of a CPU 

It moves data between the ALU and registers . 
Performs calculations and logical functions 
The data received is either stored for future use or immediately processed by the ALU. 

Bus Structures

A bus is like a road network that connects all the systems i.e memory , CPU , and I/O devices .
All data travels through the bus .
In a single-bus system, only two units can transfer data at the same time.
Buses have separate lines for data , address , and control signals to ensure smooth communication.

Using multiple buses -  In this , multiple tasks can be done at the same time.
This improves concurrency, and has higher speed , but also at higher cost . 

Handling Speed Differences 

Devices operate at different speeds(eg., keyboards vs processors )
For that , buffer registers are used , that temporarily store data for slower devices. 

Multiprocessors and Multicomputers 

Uses multiple processors for efficient task handling . 
Shared - memory systems -  all processors access common memory - faster but complex . 

Message passing systems -  each processor has its own memory - simple but slower . 
Enables parallel processing and boots system performance . 


RAM (Random access memory) - A memory in which any location can be reached in a short and fixed amount of time after specifying its address.
