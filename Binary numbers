This is a note of the things I learned about binary numbers . 
Binary numbers are very important in computers and digital systems. 
As computers don't understand regular numbers like we do , they work only with 0’s and 1s, which are called binary digits . 

We followed a few easy steps to convert to a positive decimal number into binary -
Divide the number by 2 
Write down the remainder 
Divide the answer (quotient) again by 2 and repeat the process. 
Keep doing it until the quotient becomes 0. 
Finally , read all the remainders backwards , and that's the binary number. 

An example like converting 45 to binary -
45 ÷ 2 = 22, remainder 1


22 ÷ 2 = 11, remainder 0


11 ÷ 2 = 5, remainder 1


5 ÷ 2 = 2, remainder 1


2 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 0


1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1

Now we write the remainders backwards -
So the binary of 45 is 101101.

To make sure the binary number is right , we can multiply and add 

(1 × 2⁵) = 32


(0 × 2⁴) = 0


(1 × 2³) = 8


(1 × 2²) = 4


(0 × 2¹) = 0


(1 × 2⁰) = 1


Adding them up- 32 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 45
We also learned about two’s complement , which is a way to show negative numbers in binary . 
This method makes it easier for computers to do math. 

The steps to find the two’s  complement are -

Write the positive binary version (in 8 bits).


Flip all the bits (change 0 to 1 and 1 to 0).


Add 1 to the result.

Learning how to change numbers into binary and finding two’s complement made me understand the basics of how computers store and process the data .
